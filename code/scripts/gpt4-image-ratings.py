### load the ratings data from text only prompts
script_dir = os.path.dirname(__file__)
df = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(script_dir, '../../data/gpt4_ratings_anchored_final.csv'))
### rename unnamed column to concept
df.rename(columns={'Unnamed: 0':'concept'}, inplace=True)
### get the unique concept names

### prompt structure: imagine cycling through all the concepts for each concept cycling through all color images

#### example code from OpenAI API documentation on how to use image API

# # Function to encode the image
# def encode_image(image_path):
#   with open(image_path, "rb") as image_file:
#     return base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode('utf-8')

# # Path to your image
# image_path = "path_to_your_image.jpg"

# # Getting the base64 string
# base64_image = encode_image(image_path)

# headers = {
#   "Content-Type": "application/json",
#   "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"
# }

#           "text": "Whatâ€™s in this image?"
